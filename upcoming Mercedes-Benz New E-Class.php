<h2> Mercedes-Benz New E-Class Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Mercedes E-Class has been   Indiaâ€™s favourite premium executive sedan. Launched in the late 90s, the   various iterations and generations of the E-Class have always been   enticing the Indian buyers. The E-Class that is being sold is the fourth   generation E-Class and had its midlife facelift in 2013 and is due for   an upgrade. The fifth-gen E-Class (W213) is being readied for a global   launch this year and is expected to come to India by the festive season.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Mercedes had invested almost a billion dollars into developing the   W212 facelift we have now and the W213 carries forward the design cues.   The E-Class has always been different from the S-Class and the C-Class,   but the W213 blends in. The grille is upright and pronounced while the   lines are curvy and flowing. From a distance the only thing that would   give away the E-Class from the S and the C would probably be the alloy   wheel design.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The interior too is brand new. It is more in line with the latest   Mercedes interiors we have seen with the new S-Class and the C-Class. It   feels bright and roomy and gets the new touch panel controller for the   infotainment system. The instrument cluster gets two analog dials for   the speed and the EVS and a screen between the two to read out all the   vital information. Dual zone climate control, cruise control, automatic   headlamps, rain-sensing wipers are going to be standard along with the   power adjustable front seats with memory function.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The W213 Mercedes E-Class will probably usher the straight six   engines back on to the Mercedes assembly lines globally. For us in   India, we will continue to get the 2143cc four cylinder turbo-diesel   engine developing close to 190bhp of power and 400Nm of torque for the   E220d and E250d while the E350d may get the straight six instead of the   3.0-litre turbocharged V6. The engines will power the right set of   wheels through a nine-speed gearbox except for the E63 AMG.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The new E-Class will compete with the BMW 5 Series, the Audi A6 and   the new generation Jaguar XF. We expect the new E-Class to be priced   around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).</span></p>
