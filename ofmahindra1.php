    <p class="style5">As the debate on the ban of diesel-run SUVs and luxury cars with engine capacity of 2000cc in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) continues, it looks like the car makers in the country do not wish to leave their prospective customers in lurch.Emerging reports suggest that the auto makers, who are likely to be affected the most by the ban, have already started taking necessary steps to bring down the impact of the ban. The ban, which will be effective till 31 March, 2016, has been issued in the wake of increasing pollution in Delhi, which has been ranked as the world's worst polluted city by the World Health Organisation.</p>
