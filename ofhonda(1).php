    <p class="style5">Honda Cars India is all set to initiate another price hike by up to Rs 6,000 for its car starting next month to offset the impact of the adverse exchange rate that has resulted in higher input costs.</p>

Honda Cars India currently sells Brio and Jazz hatchbacks, Amaze and City sedans, Mobilio MPV and CR-V soft roader India in the price range of Rs 4.31 lakh to Rs 26 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi.</p>
    <p>In the price hike earlier this month, Brio's price went up by up to Rs 6,000, while the Jazz and Mobilio got a price increase of up to Rs 19,500 and Rs 37,000, respectively.
