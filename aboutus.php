      <p align="left"><br />
        Our aim as an industry consolidator is to organize the much fragmented auto solutions market. Through this multi-brand innovation, we would also like to provide an alternative to the customer if he is not satisfied with his current service provider.It helps in efficient scheduling and utilizing assets more effectively. The technology assists in visibility across locations in India and also manage inventory from site to site.
      We are also looking to create joint ventures in some key states and union territories that are capable of running successful automobile dealerships. This endeavor would provide us with critical local insights and help in accelerating the roll out of operations.      </p>
