<h2> Mercedes-Benz GLA Facelift Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Mercedes GLA is the German   car makerâ€™s smallest SUV and has been built on the MFA platform that   includes the A-Class and the CLA sedan. The crossover SUV was introduced   in India back in 2014. The Mercedes A-Class received an update globally   last year and it was brought to India by Mercedes in the same year. The   CLA, which has just received its global update is expected to reach   India this year which leaves the only the GLA behind. Updated prototypes   of the GLA have been spotted testing globally and the GLA facelift is   due before the end of this year.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The GLA update, like its siblings, will be a midlife upgrade. The   front and rear bumpers have been tweaked to give the car a fresh look   though not very different from the current car. The headlamps are now   LED like the A-Class update and the tail lamps will also be tweaked. On   the inside, the GLA will continue to get the creature comforts that are   currently on the list. It includes the automatic climate control, cruise   control, steering mounted audio controls, adjustable steering, power   seats with memory function, electrically foldable mirrors et al. The   in-car infotainment system will be upgraded with an 8-inch display.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">As for the powertrains, the GLA will continue to run the same engines   that are being offered now. The 2.0-litre 181bhp petrol engine will be   offered along with the 2143cc four-cylinder turbo diesel. Both the   engines will be mated to the seven-speed dual clutch gearbox, a regular   fixture on the MFA platform. With the green tribunal ruling further   extended, Mercedes may think of bringing the 1.5-litre turbo-diesel that   develops 108bhp that is available globally.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The GLA will continue to compete with the likes of the BMW X1 and the   Audi Q3 in the Indian market along with the Mini Countryman. As for the   price tag, you can expect it to be marginally over the current car in   lieu of the equipment upgrade.</span></p>
