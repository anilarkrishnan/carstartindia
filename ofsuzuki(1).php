    <p align="center"><img src="ofsuzuki.jpg" width="646" height="450" /></p>
    <p class="style5">Apparently to boost the sale during the ongoing Pitri Paksh (a fortnight during which homage is paid to ancestors), which is considered inauspicious for any big purchase or beginning of a new work, Maruti Suzuki Nexa dealerships have been offering discounts on S-Cross crossover.</p>
    <p class="style5">A report from Atocardia indicates that the dealerships in Delhi, Gurgaon and Chennai are offering discounts starting from Rs 20,000 up to Rs 1,00,000 on the lower powered 1.3-litre DDiS variant. The bigger 1.6-litre engine equipped S-Cross gets benefits up to Rs 70,000 and bonus up to Rs 30,000 on exchange of older Maruti Suzuki cars.</p>    
    <p class="style5">The offers are only available until September 30, 2015.</p>
    <p class="style5">>Maruti Suzuki launched S-Cross as a premium car through the newly set up Nexa dealerships on August 2015. S-Cross was launched at a price ranging from Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 13.74 lakh with the option of two diesel engines.</p>
    <p class="style5">The 1.3-litre diesel motor churns out 89bhp power and 200Nm torque, and 1.6-litre diesel that is tuned to pump out 118bhp and 320Nm. The former engine is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, while the latter gets six-speed manual transmission.</p>
