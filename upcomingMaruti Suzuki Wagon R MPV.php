<h2> Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Maruti Suzuki currently sells   only the Ertiga as an MPV in the Indian market. With an intention of   providing an Indian consumer with a cheap entry-level compact MPV, the   manufacturer is developing another seven-seater vehicle based on the   Wagon R. This vehicle is expected to be launched as the third generation   of the WagonR in 2017.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd8.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/e9/13/16897/img/ol/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-MPV-Left-Side-View-44456.jpg?t=155724110&amp;t=155724110" title="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV" alt="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Exterior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The company will want to avail the excise duty benefits for a car of   length under four metres, which will eventually help them price the car   aggressively. With that in mind, the manufacturer will keep it under   four metres in length and make changes to the design of the Wagon R   accordingly. The tall-boy design hatchback has enough space in the cabin   and the manufacturer should not find it much difficult to incorporate   the third row of seats in the new MPV.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd8.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/e9/13/16897/img/ol/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-MPV-Front-view-44452.jpg?t=155551300&amp;t=155551300" title="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Front view" alt="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Front view" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">In terms of external appearance we don't think the manufacturer might   bring in extensive changes and rather stick to the current styling that   is quite widely accepted in our country. Nevertheless, the carmaker   will borrow design cues from the seven-seater concept of the Wagon R   showcased at the Indonesia International Motor Show in 2013. The   distance between the C and D pillars of the concept exhibited at the   event was increased showing a larger glass window between these pillars.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd5.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/e9/13/16897/img/ol/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-MPV-Right-Side-44453.jpg?t=155605920&amp;t=155605920" title="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Right Side" alt="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Right Side" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Interior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Wagon R is gets a fairly decent interior and we can expect   similar treatment to the cabin of the upcoming car. The major change   will be the accommodation of the third row of seats which will be   possible due to the space created by increasing the distance between the   C and D pillars. With a slight variation in cabin and headroom, the   company will create more space for the last row and by equipping the car   with more utilitarian features, the practicality of the car should   definitely go up.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd6.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/e9/13/16897/img/ol/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-MPV-Rear-Seat-Space-44454.jpg?t=155630893&amp;t=155630893" title="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Rear Seat Space" alt="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Rear Seat Space" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Engine and Gearbox</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">At present, the Wagon R is powered only by the petrol engine, but we   expect the manufacturer to also start employing the diesel mill with the   advent of this compact MPV. The current three cylinder 998cc K10B   series engine produces 67bhp of power and 90Nm of torque which might   seem an underpowered option for the bigger car. The 83bhp 1.2-litre   petrol motor and 74bhp 1.3-litre diesel powerplant from the Swift can be   a good option for the Wagon R MPV. <img src="http://imgd7.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/e9/13/16897/img/ol/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-MPV-Rear-view-44455.jpg?t=155643267&amp;t=155643267" title="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Rear view" alt="Maruti Suzuki Wagon R MPV Rear view" width="622" /> </span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Price and Competition</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Wagon R has been a successful model for Maruti Suzuki and is   considered as one of the most practical cars in the Indian car market.   With the addition of the third row of seats, the company might increase   the practicality aspect further. The new seven-seater Wagon R will go up   against the Mahindra Quanto and the upcoming Datsun Go+ and should also   serve as an economical alternative to the Ertiga, Honda Mobilio,   Hyundai i20 crossover and even the Toyota Innova in the MPV segment of   cars. If priced between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh, we think the car has a   major potential to be a hit especially in the rural market in India.</span></p>
