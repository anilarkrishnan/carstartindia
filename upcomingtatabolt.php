<h2> Tata Bolt Sport Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Tata Motors showcased the Bolt   Sport at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. It will be the first hot hatch from   the carmakerâ€™s stable, and will be launched in India under the   company's new performance brand. This new model is the   performance-oriented version of the Bolt hatchback and offers more power   and a sportier look than the version currently on sale. It is likely to   be introduced in India by the end of this year.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Exterior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">In line with the new sporty design language, the Bolt Sport gets a   new grille, projector headlamps and a sporty body kit with new rear   bumper as well. The 17-inch alloy wheels are newly designed. Apart from   the body kit and side skirts, the Bolt Sport also features sleek air   vents on the front fenders, continuing the  sporty theme. At the back a   roof spoiler, a brush metal strip on the number plate and a new bumper   with a pair of diffusers can be seen.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Interior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">There are changes to the interior as well which include a black   leather upholstery with contrasting red stitches and accents, sunroof,   Harman touch-screen infotainment system with voice recognition and SMS   readout, etc. On the safety front, the new model is equipped with   speed-dependent volume control, anti-lock braking system (ABS), corner   stability control and dual airbags.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Engine and Gearbox</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Tata Bolt Sport will be powered by the same 1.2-litre   turbocharged petrol engine seen under the regular version of the Bolt   and Zest. However, the mill for the Bolt Sport is tuned for higher   performance, and churns out 120bhp of power and 170Nm of torque. This   motor comes mated to a five-speed manual gearbox that sends power to the   front wheels of the car. Just like the Bolt on sale now, the Bolt Sport   also offers multi-drive options - Eco, City and Sport.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Price and Competition</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">At present only a few hot hatches are available in our country. The   Bolt Sport will up the game and go up against the Volkswagen Polo GT,   Punto Abarth, the upcoming Active i20, Datsun Redi GO etc. It might be   priced in the range of Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 8 lakh when launched for the   Indian market.</span></p>
