<h2> Skoda Kodiaq Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Kodiaq is Skodaâ€™s first ever   SUV that offers seven seats. Based on the MQB platform which it shares   with the Volkswagen Tiguan and the Seat Ateca, the Kodiaq is built   primarily for the Asian and Chinese markets. The name Kodiaq is inspired   from the largest species of brown bear and the SUV was showcased as the   Vision S concept at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this year.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Kodiaq will be styled after the family face of the moustache   grille and rectangular headlamps. The vertically slatted grille   dominates the front fascia and a three-part air dam lending it the   required aggression. The swept back headlamps will get projector units.   The Kodiaq is a full-size SUV and it shows in its 4.7 metre long   profile. It gets a long hood, a prominent shoulder line, squared wheel   arches and a sloping roof. The tail should look sleek with the wrap   around tail lamps, a raked windshield and a hemline on the tail-gate.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Since the car has not been unveiled globally as yet, there is not   much information about the interiors. But going by Skoda standards, the   cabin will be premium and laid out with typical German simplicity. It   will get the latest generation infotainment system from the VW group and   the buttons on the console may be touch-sensitive. Dual-zone climate   control with separate blowers for the rear seats should be standard   along with auto-dimming interior mirror, electric folding wing mirrors,   headlamp wash function et al. The middle row might be adjustable to free   some more space for the third row passengers.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Under the hood, you will get the 2.0-litre petrol and diesel engine   options with both manual and DSG automatic gearboxes and   four-wheel-drive. The 2.0-litre TSI turbocharged petrol mill will   develop 177bhp of power from 4200rpm and 320Nm of torque from 1500rpm.   The 2.0-litre turbo-diesel churns out a slightly higher 187bhp of power   at 3800rpm and 400Nm of torque. The entry-level versions of the Kodiaq   may be offered with two-wheel drive and a lower state of tune for the   above engines.</span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">The Kodiaq is a full-sized seven seater SUV and at 4.7metres length,   it is the ideal competitor for Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour, Hyundai   Santa Fe and the Mitsubishi Pajero. India launch of the Skoda Kodiaq is   expected in 2017 with a price tag between Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh.</span></p>
