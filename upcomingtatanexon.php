<h2> Tata Nexon Preview </h2>
<div>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">With SUVs being the flavour of   the season, Tata Motors seems to have picked up the scent and has been   busy constructing a compact SUV for our market. Speculations have   suggested that this SUV should be ready to hit showrooms in 2017 and if   this is anything to go by, we can expect Tata to showcase this compact   SUV in its concept stages at the upcoming 2016 Auto Expo in Delhi.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd5.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/D5/EB/16868/img/ol/Tata-Nexon-Right-Front-Three-Quarter-44113.jpg?t=155639133&amp;t=155639133" title="Tata Nexon" alt="Tata Nexon" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Exterior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">We can safely presume that this baby SUV from Tata could be visually   built around the design cues of the Zest and Bolt while retaining the   dimensional strengths of the present segment contenders like the   EcoSport and TUV300.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd1.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/D5/EB/16868/img/l/Tata-Nexon-Left-Side-View-44114.jpg?20140912155254" title="Tata Nexon Left Side View " alt="Tata Nexon Left Side View" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Interior</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">In all likelihood we can be prepared to find interior layouts that   match Tataâ€™s current design flair as seen on their other cars in the   market today. Also anticipate an array of contemporary features like the   car maker has recently incorporated in the Zica hatchback.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd7.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/D5/EB/16868/img/ol/Tata-Nexon-Front-view-44115.jpg?t=160646307&amp;t=160646307" title="Tata Nexon Front view" alt="Tata Nexon Front view" width="622" /> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><strong>Engine</strong></span></p>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Tata might carry on with the successful 1.3-litre multijet diesel   with the output of 90bhp at 4,000rpm and torque of 200Nm at   1,750-3,000rpm. While a five-speed manual transmission will be   available, we may also get to taste the five-speed AMT gearbox too.   Petrol power will be supplied from the 1.2-litre motor that presently   powers the Zest and Bolt. 90bhp at 5,000rpm along with 140Nm at   1,500-4,000rpm is what this engine generates and will be mated to a   five-speed manual box.</span></p>
  <span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis"><img src="http://imgd8.aeplcdn.com/0x0/ec/D5/EB/16868/img/ol/Tata-Nexon-Rear-view-44124.jpg?t=162934140&amp;t=162934140" title="Tata Nexon Rear view" alt="Tata Nexon Rear view" width="622" /> <strong>Price and competition</strong> </span>
  <p><span id="spnLargeDescSynopsis">Tata is likely to introduce this important SUV in the Indian market   to compete with the likes of the Ford EcoSport, Mahindra TUV300 and the   upcoming Maruti Vitara Brezza. Prices should be in the range of Rs 6.50   lakh to Rs 10.50 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).</span></p>
